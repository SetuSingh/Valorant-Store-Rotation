# Valorant-Store-Rotation
This Python script allows for the scraping of in-game information such as user store rotation, available currency, user rank, and more, without the need to launch the game.

The script is designed to run on both Android and PC platforms. It provides the flexibility to execute the script on either an Android device or a PC without any hassle. Importing and installing dependencies and modules is taken care of automatically by the script, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Special thanks go to rumblemike on Twitter for providing the API that enables the functionality of this script.
